"turn_number_time_series_r00.5" >>> Equilibrium bond length r_0 = 0.5 and total bead numbers N = 127. 

"turn_number_time_series_r00.75" >>> Equilibrium bond length r_0 = 0.75 and total bead numbers N = 85.

"turn_number_time_series_r01" >>> Equilibrium bond length r_0 = 1.0 and total bead numbers N = 64.

We kept the total equilibrium chain length ( L = (N-1)*r_0 ) constant for all our simulations.

The sub folder "ens#" >>> '#' denotes 0, 1, ..., 19 for 20 different initial conditions. Here we collected 20 different time series for 20 different initial conditions. 

The file name "turn_number_time_ens#_v$.d.gz" contains single column data set of turn number with time gap 0.000016.

'$' denotes the free MPs velocity v_0 values 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100.

The constants in the simulations : \omega_{on}/\omega_{0} = 1.0, \sigma = 1.0.
