We presented the results in the paper with averaging over 20 different initial conditions. The folder named "ens*" where '*' denotes 0,1,...,19 for 20 different initial conditions. And the folder named "v#" where '#' denotes the free MPs velocity v_0 values 0,1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,100.

# Total bead numbers N = 64, Total equilibrium length of the chain L=(N-1)*r_0=63 where the equilibrium bond length r_0 = 1. 

dist_rg.tar.xz >>>>> Distribution of Rg squared for different velocity of the MPs v_0 and different attachment-detachment ratio won/w0=0.5,1.0,5.0,10.0,20.0.

dist_turn_number.tar.xz >>>>> Distribution of turn number for different velocity of the MPs v_0 and different attachment-detachment ratio won/w0=0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,1.0,2.0,5.0,10.0,20.0.

dist_turn_number_r00.75.tar.xz >>>>> r_0=0.75, The total bead numbers should be 85 to keep L constant. Distribution of turn number for different velocity of the MPs v_0 with won/w0=1.0.


dist_turn_number_r00.5.tar.xz >>>>> r_0=0.5, The total bead numbers should be 127 to keep L constant. Distribution of turn number for different velocity of the MPs v_0 with won/w0=1.0.
