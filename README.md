Folder named "turn_number_time_series_r0*" where '*' represents 0.5, 0.75 and 1.

"turn_number_time_series_r00.5" >>> Equilibrium bond length r_0 = 0.5 and total bead numbers N = 127. 

"turn_number_time_series_r00.75" >>> Equilibrium bond length r_0 = 0.75 and total bead numbers N = 85.

"turn_number_time_series_r01" >>> Equilibrium bond length r_0 = 1.0 and total bead numbers N = 64.

We presented the results in the paper with averaging over 20 different initial conditions. The folder named "ens#" where '#' denotes 0,1,...,19 for 20 different initial conditions. 

The file name "turn_number_time_ens#_v$.d.gz" contains single column data set of turn number with time gap 0.000016.

And the folder named "v#" where '#' denotes the free MPs velocity v_0 values 0,1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,100.

Total bead numbers N = 64, Total equilibrium length of the chain L = (N-1)*r_0 = 63 where the equilibrium bond length r_0 = 1.
